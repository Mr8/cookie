Usage
-----

Generate a Python package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/Mr8/cookie.git 

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there.
* Add the repo to your Travis CI account.
* Add the repo to your ReadTheDocs account + turn on the ReadTheDocs service hook.
* Release your package the standard Python way. Here's a release checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/5990987

Not Exactly What You Want?
--------------------------

Don't worry, you have options:

Similar Cookiecutter Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of this with a PyTest test runner,
  strict flake8 checking with Travis/Tox, and some docs and `setup.py` differences.
  
* `tony/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: Fork with py2.7+3.3 optimizations. Flask/Werkzeug-style
  test runner, ``_compat`` module and module/doc conventions. See ``README.rst`` or
  the `github comparison view`_ for exhaustive list of additions and modifications.

* Also see the `network`_ and `family tree`_ for this repo. (If you find
  anything that should be listed here, please add it and send a pull request!)

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description. 

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.

Or Submit a Pull Request

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own packaging experience better.
